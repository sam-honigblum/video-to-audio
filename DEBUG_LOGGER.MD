# Debug Log 1: CAVP Model Loading Issue

## Issue Description
- Error when loading CAVP model checkpoint due to state dictionary key mismatches
- Missing keys: "audio_encoder.bn.weight", "audio_encoder.bn.bias", etc.
- Unexpected keys: "audio_encoder.bn0.weight", "audio_encoder.bn0.bias", etc.

## Root Cause
The checkpoint was saved with an older version of the model architecture where the audio encoder used different layer naming conventions (e.g., "bn0" instead of "bn").

## Solution Implemented
1. Modified CAVP_VideoOnly class to handle state dictionary mismatch:
   - Added key mapping to convert old layer names to new ones
   - Specifically mapped:
     - "bn0" → "bn"
     - "fc_audioset" → "project_head"
   - Used strict=False when loading state dict to handle any remaining mismatches

## Files Modified
1. src/models/cavp_encoder.py
   - Updated CAVP_VideoOnly.__init__ method
   - Added state dictionary key mapping logic
   - Maintained existing functionality while adding compatibility layer

## Next Steps
1. Test the modified code with the checkpoint
2. Verify that the model loads correctly
3. Monitor for any remaining state dict mismatches

# Debug Log 2: LatentDiffusion Initialization Issue

## Issue Description
- Error: 'LatentDiffusion' object has no attribute 'alphas_cumprod'
- The error occurs during DPMSolverSampler initialization
- The alphas_cumprod buffer is not properly initialized before being accessed

## Root Cause
1. The alphas_cumprod buffer is not being properly registered in the LatentDiffusion class
2. The initialization order in LatentDiffusion needs to be fixed
3. The buffer registration needs to be done before any other components try to access it

## Solution Implemented
1. Modified LatentDiffusion class initialization:
   - Added proper buffer registration for all diffusion parameters
   - Ensured buffers are registered before any component initialization
   - Added validation checks for required attributes
   - Fixed the initialization order to match the diffusers library requirements

## Files Modified
1. src/models/latent_diffusion.py
   - Updated initialization sequence
   - Added proper buffer registration
   - Added validation checks
   - Ensured compatibility with DPMSolverSampler requirements

## Next Steps
1. Test the modified code
2. Verify that the sampler initializes correctly
3. Monitor for any remaining initialization issues

# Debug Log 3: LatentDiffusion Missing Method Issue

## Issue Description
- Error: 'LatentDiffusion' object has no attribute 'q_sample'
- The error occurs during the forward pass of training
- The q_sample method is missing from the LatentDiffusion class

## Root Cause
1. The LatentDiffusion class is missing the q_sample method which is required for the forward pass
2. This method is needed to perform the diffusion process during training
3. The method should use the registered buffers (alphas_cumprod) to add noise to the latent

## Solution Implemented
1. Added q_sample method to LatentDiffusion class:
   - Implemented the forward diffusion process
   - Used registered buffers for noise addition
   - Added proper error handling and validation

## Files Modified
1. src/models/latent_diffusion.py
   - Added q_sample method
   - Ensured proper use of registered buffers
   - Added validation checks

## Next Steps
1. Test the modified code
2. Verify that training proceeds correctly
3. Monitor for any remaining issues

# Debug Log 4: CAVP Encoder Empty Tensor Issue

## Issue Description
- Error: RuntimeError: permute(sparse_coo): number of dimensions in the tensor input does not match the length of the desired ordering of dimensions
- The error occurs in CAVP forward method when trying to permute an empty tensor
- The CAVP_VideoOnly class is passing torch.empty(0) as spectrogram input, but the forward method expects a 4D tensor

## Root Cause
1. The CAVP_VideoOnly forward method passes torch.empty(0) as the spectrogram input to simulate video-only processing
2. The CAVP.forward method tries to permute this empty tensor as if it were a 4D spectrogram tensor
3. The permute operation fails because the empty tensor has 1 dimension, not 4

## Solution Implemented
1. Modified CAVP.forward method to handle empty spectrogram input:
   - Added check for empty spectrogram tensor
   - Skip audio processing when spectrogram is empty
   - Return appropriate dummy values for audio features
   - Maintain video processing functionality

## Files Modified
1. src/models/cavp_encoder.py
   - Updated CAVP.forward method to handle empty spectrogram input
   - Added conditional processing for video-only mode
   - Ensured proper return values for both video and audio features

## Next Steps
1. Test the modified code
2. Verify that video processing works correctly in video-only mode
3. Monitor for any remaining tensor shape issues

# Debug Log 5: PEFT/Accelerate Version Compatibility Issue

## Issue Description
- Error: ImportError: cannot import name 'clear_device_cache' from 'accelerate.utils.memory'
- The error occurs when the UNet model tries to use LoRA layers
- This is a version compatibility issue between peft and accelerate libraries

## Root Cause
1. The installed version of `peft` is trying to import `clear_device_cache` from `accelerate.utils.memory`
2. The installed version of `accelerate` doesn't have this function or it's in a different location
3. This suggests a version mismatch between the two libraries

## Solution Implemented
1. Disable LoRA scaling in the UNet forward call:
   - Set lora_scale=None when calling UNet forward
   - This bypasses the problematic LoRA scaling code
   - Alternatively, upgrade/downgrade library versions to compatible ones

## Files Modified
1. src/models/latent_diffusion.py
   - Modified UNet forward call to disable LoRA scaling
   - Added error handling for version compatibility issues

## Next Steps
1. Test the modified code with LoRA scaling disabled
2. Consider upgrading/downgrading library versions if LoRA is needed
3. Monitor for any impact on model performance
